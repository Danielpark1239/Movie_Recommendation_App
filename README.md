# Rotten Tomatoes Recommendation App

Website that generates movie/TV show recommendations by scraping Rotten Tomatoes based on user filters

Built using Flask, Bulma, and BeautifulSoup

~~Hosted at https://rt-recommendations.herokuapp.com/~~

* Available until Nov 28, 2022, when Heroku shuts down free dynos; not feasible to deploy on Render with a free plan,
  so the website is no longer active
~~* Note: webscraping apps are difficult to maintain, so the website may fail to generate recommendations.
  For example, the Rotten Tomatoes website could change its format or some of my proxies may go down.~~
