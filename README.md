# Rotten Tomatoes Recommendation App

Website that generates movie/TV show recommendations by scraping Rotten Tomatoes based on user filters

Built using Flask, Bulma, and BeautifulSoup

Hosted at https://rt-recommendations.herokuapp.com/

* Note: webscraping apps are difficult to maintain, so the website may fail to generate recommendations.
  For example, the Rotten Tomatoes website could change its format or some of my proxies may go down.
  This is meant to be a demo app, and I'll be able to demo a working version on request.
* Available until Nov 28, 2022, when Heroku shuts down free dynos
