# Tomato Recommendations

Website that generates movie/TV show recommendations by scraping Rotten Tomatoes based on user filters

Built using Flask, Bulma, and BeautifulSoup

~~Hosted at https://rt-recommendations.herokuapp.com/~~

* Available until Nov 28, 2022, when Heroku shuts down free dynos; not feasible to deploy on Render with a free plan,
  so the website is no longer active :(
* Note: This app is no longer maintained, so it may fail to generate recommendations. If the Rotten Tomatoes website has changed, the webscraping code has to be changed. *
