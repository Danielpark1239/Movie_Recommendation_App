# Rotten Tomatoes Recommendation App

Website that generates movie/TV show recommendations by scraping Rotten Tomatoes based on user filters

Built using Flask, Bulma, and BeautifulSoup

Hosted at https://rt-recommendations.herokuapp.com/

* Note: webscraping apps are difficult to maintain, so the website may fail to generate recommendations. 
  This is meant to be a demo app, and I'll be able to demo a working version on request.
* Available until Nov 28, 2022, when Heroku shuts down free dynos
